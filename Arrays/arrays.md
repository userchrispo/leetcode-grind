# Arrays

## Overview

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

## Key Characteristics

- **Fixed Size**: Size determined at creation
- **Zero-Indexed**: First element at index 0
- **Contiguous Memory**: Elements stored sequentially
- **Homogeneous**: All elements are the same type

## Common Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    | O(1)            |
| Search    | O(n)            |
| Insert    | O(n)            |
| Delete    | O(n)            |

## Common Patterns

- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Prefix sum
- Binary search
